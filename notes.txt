WEB RTC
web rtc is use from direct connection between two computers

we share our public ip addresses to other othe pc by server 
as both both pc are conneccted we do not need server 
we can directly share data between two

1. know our own public ip TURN ICE
2. share our public ip by signalling
3. now we can use media sharing

only two devices can connect to each other at a time

and we have 3 architecture for it
1. peer-2-peer best and suitable for 2 pc interaction
2. mesh topology every device is connected to other
3. SFU . all device are connected to a server and server create a single grid which has frame of all devices and that grid is shared to all devices looking like all are connected
